Stratus is an intent-based DEX that enables slippage-free, MEV-resistant spot trading by executing user intents through signed quotes, leveraging RFQ-style execution while preserving on-chain finality and intent privacy.

Users submit trade intents and receive signed, executable quotes from solvers, which can be filled instantly on-chain. combining TradFi-grade execution certainty with DeFi composability, enabling private price discovery and secure trade finality


- Leading the development of a unified quote aggregator that abstracts pricing across onchain and offchain liquidity sources, forming the foundation of an intent-based execution framework.

- Working on core components that normalize liquidity data, resolve token paths, and return structured output for downstream relayers and routing modules.

- Participating in the architecture of a modular backend system responsible for routing logic, fallback handling, and execution submission under intent-based models.

- Collaborating on the design of a multi-pool AMM architecture to support concentrated liquidity, token routing, and solver interoperability across multiple liquidity sources.

- Contributing to internal system diagrams, specifications, and PoCs to support team alignment, future audits, and external integration readiness.

#### Multiply Leverage vault (DFS)

By using Defi-Saver Smart Accounts (DSA) to create simple leverage for users. At the backend we will utilize smart accounts to perform chained smart contract actions of leveraging and deleveraging accordingly. Users will only input the deposit amount of TBILLs or USDC, and we will initiate a position account for them. 

Smart accounts utilizes the Proxy pattern where the user owns a DS-Proxy contract that enables executing a number of methods in a ProxyActions contract where the user only has to sign one transaction. The user and our superadmin are the direct owner of the DSAs. The superadmin role is to automate rebalances for the user whenever leverage level goes beyond a threshold.
